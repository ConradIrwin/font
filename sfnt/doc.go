// Package sfnt provides support for sfnt based font formats.
//
// This includes OpenType, TrueType, WOFF, WOFF2, and EOT (though EOT is currently unimplemented).
//
// Usually you will want to parse a font, make modifications, and then output the modified
// font. If you're really brave, you can build a new font from scratch.
